# Advanced Unix Programming - Car Manufacturing Factory Simulation

## Problem Definition
A car is manufactured at each stop on a conveyor belt in a car factory. A car is constructed 
from the following 6 parts: i) chassis, ii) tires, iii) seats, iv) engine (assume this includes everything 
under the hood and the steering wheel), v) top cover, and vi) painting. Thus, there are 6 tasks in 
manufacturing a car. However, tires, seats or the engine cannot be added until the chassis is placed 
on the belt. The top cover cannot be added until tires, seats and the engine are put in. Finally, the 
car cannot be painted until the top cover is put on. There are four types of technicians assigned to 
the above tasks in the car factory: Type A technician is skilled at adding tires and painting, Type 
B can only put the chassis on the belt, Type C only knows how to attach the seats, and Type D 
knows how to add the engine as well as how to add the top cover. 

## Info

* Solution is a basic C console application.
* Explanation of variables and code blocks are given in code as comments 
* Observation of different results can be done on the console output by making arrangements on variables.
